# UI-elements-detection

Overview

This project aims to develop an object detection model using YOLOv8 to identify and classify various UI elements on webpages. The model is trained to detect elements such as buttons, checkboxes, dropdown forms, text, links, and more. The trained model can be used to analyze Figma webpages and identify relevant UI elements, creating bounding boxes around each element and tagging them with the corresponding element name.

Features

Object detection and classification of UI elements

Bounding box visualization around detected elements

Element tagging with corresponding names
